amvstrm is an open-source self-hostable anime streaming site powered by amvstrm's API.

- [Official Documentation](https://docs.amvstr.me)

**We decided to shut down, cease the website operation, and archive the website & API repo. Please read more at our [Docs website](https://docs.amvstr.me/the-future).**

For those who haven't migrated the API, please do so, as we will shut down the API server next month. Only the documentation website will remain operational. 

During the shutdown, we still retain the copyright to the name and logo, and anyone who uses the logo and name will be reminded via email. Please report to us at contact@nyt92.eu.org or nyt92@uninbox.me if you have seen websites that are still operating under the name of amvstrm and logo.
